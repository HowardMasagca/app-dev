# MY FAVORITE SERIES/MOVIES

## 1. Bleach

### It is a story that tells about soul reapers, quincy, and arrancar that to separate the 3 worlds. Hueco mundo, soul society, and Quincy from interfering in the world.

### Impressions

-The plot twist of the story itself is interesting, providing more actions and side stories, also the characters are good especially in their design and their style and bankai.


## 2. Nanatsu no Taizai
### It is a historical series that has great characters of seven deadly sins against the demon realm and the deity. They're fighting on it because they wanted to break the curse of perpetual rebirth and everlasting life.

### Impressions

-Their powers are all great when it comes to fighting their opponents in which make it more interesting.
